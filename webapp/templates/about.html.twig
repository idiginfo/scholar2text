<p>
    XtractPDF is a simple tool and web services API for getting text data from PDF files.  I built
    it to simplify this process.  The tool was built using popular open-source PDF extration tools.

<h4>Is there a Charge?</h4>

<p>
    No. XtractPDF is free to use, and the libraries that power it are available as open-source.
</p>

<h4>Are PDFs Stored on the Sever</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Absolutely Not!</strong>  PDFs are deleted as soon as they are previewed in the browser or
    downloaded once after API extraction.  In the event that a PDF is not deleted immediately, a cleanup
    script deletes it after five minutes.
</p>

<h4>Is there an API?</h4>

<p>
    Yes! You can use XtractPDF programmatically, as long as you don't abuse the service.
