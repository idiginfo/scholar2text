Aims and objectives. To describe factors associated with the subjective quality of life of individuals who had attempted suicide. Background. Although quality of life has been a focus of concern in mental health care, data are lacking on what life is like and what factors are related to an individual’s quality of life after a suicide attempt. Design. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. Methods. Participants comprised a convenience sample of 103 individuals who had attempted suicide within the previous three months and received follow-up care from one suicide-prevention centre in northern Taiwan. Participants were assessed for depression and quality of life using the Beck Depression Inventory, Taiwan version and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Instrument-BREF, Taiwan version, respectively. Results. Almost half the participants (n = 49) had severe depression and one-third of them (n = 30) reattempted suicide while receiving follow-up care. Depression and quality-of-life scores were statistically signiﬁcantly inversely correlated. Participants’ quality-of-life scores were most associated with their depressive level, reattempting suicide during suicidal follow-up care, high educational level and older age. Conclusions. The present study indicates that factors associated with quality of life decreased more in individuals with moderate/severe depression than in those with mild depression. In addition, individuals who reattempted suicide during follow-up care were more likely to suffer from poor life quality. Relevance to clinical practice. Mental health professionals should include frequent evaluation of depressive status and quality of life in follow-up care for patients who have recently attempted suicide. Particularly, mental health professionals must treat suicidal individuals with a high tendency to reattempt suicide by establishing trust with them and allowing them to narrate their painful experiences during follow-up care.

Introduction

Suicide is a worldwide mental health problem. In Taiwan, suicide accounted for 168 deaths per 100,000 population in 2010 (Department of Health R.O.C. 2011), more than

the global average of approximately 16 deaths per 100,000 population (World Health Organisation 2012). Suicidal individuals in Taiwan have a high risk of repeated suicide attempt, especially within the ﬁrst year of self-harm (Chen et al. 2010a). Moreover, suicide sometimes results from

decreased life satisfaction associated with depression (Fujino et al. 2005, Bray & Gunnell 2006). Suicide-related studies have focused on suicide rates (Mok et al. 2012), assessment and diagnosis (Edelstein et al. 2009), suicidal behaviours and methods (Lin et al. 2010) and risk factors for suicidal behaviours (Chen et al. 2010a), but few studies have explored quality of life (QOL) to help mental health professionals understand how individuals adapt following a suicide attempt. The purpose of this study therefore was to examine factors associated with QOL in individuals who attempted suicide within the previous three months.

Background In Taiwan, the male/female suicide death ratio is 21:1 (Department of Health R.O.C. 2011). Suicide death rates increase with increasing age. One-third of deaths by suicide occur among those 25–44 years old (Department of Health R.O.C. 2011). The most common methods of suicide in Taiwan are hanging, charcoal-burning and pesticide poisoning (Lin et al. 2010). Risk factors for suicide include unemployment (Chen et al. 2010b), being unmarried, history of psychiatric illness (Cheng 1995, Hung et al. 2010), physical illness (Hung et al. 2000), ﬁrst-degree family history of suicide and history of repeated suicide attempts (Tsai et al. 2002). Furthermore, death by suicide increased signiﬁcantly following media reports of a celebrity suicide (Chen et al. 2012). Those who attempt suicide tended to reattempt suicide within the ﬁrst year (Berlim et al. 2006, Chen et al. 2010a, Simon 2011) and even sooner after a psychiatric hospitalisation (Meehan et al. 2006), especially if they were females, living with family members, had a history of psychiatric treatments (Beghi & Rosenbaum 2010, Oh et al. 2011) and suffered from depression and substance abuse (da Silva Cais et al. 2009). Signiﬁcant risk factors for immediate postdischarge suicide among psychiatric patients in Hong Kong were being out of contact after discharge and living alone (Kan et al. 2007). Unfortunately, many people who attempt suicide do not receive follow-up mental health care (Olfson et al. 2012). In Taiwan, only 13% of sought mental individuals health services during the month before their death by suicide (Lee et al. 2008). One reason for not seeking help might be the cultural stigma associated with suicide (Tzeng & Lipson 2004). Thus, Taiwan established the National Suicide and High Risk Group Notiﬁcation System, which lists individuals who have attempted suicide (with their permission) and are provided three months of follow-up

care by a case manager from the National Suicide-Prevention Centre. After this policy was implemented, deaths by suicide decreased from 214–178 per 100,000 in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (Ho et al. 2011), but little is known about how individuals in the community adapt after attempting suicide. To understand how a disease or event such as a suicide attempt inﬂuences one’s physical, mental and social wellbeing, QOL must be assessed [World Health Organisation (WHO) Group 1997]. A brief version of the WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) was developed for use when time is restricted and respondent burden should be minimised. Measuring QOL to assess likelihood of suicide attempts is supported by previous research. For example, poor QOL was associated with suicidal ideation and suggested as a marker for poor adaptation and inadequate social support in individuals with HIV-AIDS (Kalichman et al. 2000). Similarly, suicidal patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder had signiﬁcantly lower scores in all four WHOQOL-BREF domains than their non-suicidal counterparts (de Abreu et al. 2012). Likewise, suicidal patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Taiwan had significantly lower QOL scores in the social domain, after adjustthan their non-suicidal ing for depressive symptoms, (Kao et al. 2012). Furthermore, counterparts suicidal patients in Sweden had signiﬁcantly lower health-related QOL scores in all domains than the general population (Borg et al. 2010). An outcome similar to QOL, life satisfaction, was found to be an important indicator for suicide risk in a nationwide sample of Finnish adults (KoivumaaHonkanen et al. 2001). Another variable correlated with QOL in both physical and psychiatric patients is depression. Indeed, QOL was even lower in depressed patients than in patients with chronic illnesses, for example hypertension, end-stage renal disease, chronic lumbar pain and cancer (Demyttenaere et al. 2002, Berlim et al. 2006). Furthermore, depression has been considered a risk factor for reattempting suicide (Nrugham et al. 2012). These results indicate that monitoring depressive symptoms and understanding patients’ QOL after suicide attempts are critical in caring for suicidal patients. However, data are lacking on what life is like and what factors are related to an individual’s QOL after attempting suicide in Taiwan.

Aim

The aim of this study was to describe the factors associated with subjective QOL of Taiwanese individuals after a suicide attempt within the previous three months.

Methods

A cross-sectional research design was used in this study. Individuals were recruited by convenience from one mental hospital in a rural area of northern Taiwan. Individuals were recruited from the hospital’s suicide-prevention centre if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) >20 years old, (2) attempted suicide within the previous three months, (3) included in the national suicide and high-risk group notiﬁcation list, (4) could read and write, and (5) received follow-up care by case managers from the hospital’s suicide-prevention centre. Among 172 individuals referred to the suicide-prevention centre, 158 met the inclusion criteria. Of these 158 individuals, 112 agreed to participate, but nine dropped out during data collection, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 103 (response rate = 65%).

Data were collected on participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics, depressive level and QOL using a three-part questionnaire: (1) a demographic and clinical data form, (2) the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Taiwan version (Beck et al. 1996, Chen 2000), and (3) the WHOQOL-BREF, Taiwan version (WHO Group 1997, Yao 2002). Demographic data included participants’ gender, age, marital status, education level, employment status, monthly family income and religious status. Clinical data included history of depression, history of suicide attempts and history of suicide attempts while receiving follow-up care. The 21-item BDI is a self-report questionnaire examining depressive level by focusing on depressive symptoms, cognition and physical symptoms during the previous two weeks (Beck et al. 1996). Item scores (range = 0–3) are summed for a global score ranging from 0–63. Higher scores signify more severe depression. BDI scores are categorised as follows: 0– 13 indicates minimal depression, 14–19 mild depression, 20– 28 moderate depression and 29–63 severe depression. The Chinese version BDI has well-established internal consistency and construct validity (Chen 2000). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha for the Chinese version BDI was 0.93. The 24-item WHOQOL-BREF includes four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships (World Health Organisation Group and environment 1997). The scale also has two overall items measuring general QOL. The WHOQOL-BREF, Taiwan version includes not only the original 26 items, but also two

culture-speciﬁc questions reﬂecting the Taiwanese cultural values of being respected/accepted by others (social relationships domain) and eating food that one loves (environmental domain) (Yao 2002). Item scores range from 1–5. Mean scores are calculated for all items of each domain, with higher scores indicating better QOL. In this study, scale was 094 and Cronbach’s alpha for the overall Cronbach’s alphas for individual domains ranged from 072–086.

Data were collected between April 2008–March 2009. The ﬁrst author explained the purpose of the study to potential participants, who received an information sheet outlining the study aims and protection of conﬁdentiality. After obtaining written informed consent, the ﬁrst author gave participants anonymous, self-administered questionnaires (as described above) and a return envelope. All questionnaires were returned directly to the ﬁrst author.

Permission for the study was obtained from the institutional review boards of the study hospital and the principal investigator’s university.

Data analysis

SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (Data Statistical Analysis Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC) was used for statistical processing with signiﬁcance set at 005. Demographic characteristics, BDI scores and mean scores for the four WHOQOL-BREF domains were described by means, standard deviations and percentages. Group differences in the four WHOQOL-BREF domains were determined by independent t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Associations among different continuous variables were identiﬁed by Pearson’s correlations. The generalised linear model was used to identify signiﬁcant explanatory variables associated with the four WHOQOL-BREF domains. This approach provides ﬂexible statistical modelling and enables non-normal distributions of dependent variables (Wang et al. 2010).

Results

Participant demographics

Among the 103 participants in the ﬁnal sample, 15% were 20–24 years old, 62% were 25–44 years old, and 23%

S-M Wang et al. were  45 years old. Their average age was 367 years (SD = 1035, range: 20–65). The majority (60%) were females and without a partner (73%) (Table 1). The majority (73%) had completed senior high school or above, were unemployed (73%) and had a low monthly income (58%). Their mean BDI score was 2822  1527 (range = 0–60), with 49 (476%) having a BDI score  29, indicating severe depression. Surprisingly, 30 (29%) participants admitted reattempting suicide while receiving three-month suicidal follow-up care.

Relationship of participants’ characteristics with QOL

Participants’ mean WHOQOL-BREF scores for physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environmental domains were 1123 (SD = 318), 924

Table 1 Participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics as well as depressive level and quality-of-life scores (n = 103)

(SD = 326), 1040 (SD = 307), and 1117 (SD = 302), respectively. Participants’ mean score for overall QOL was 267 (SD = 098) and for global health status was 250 (SD = 103). In Table 2, participants whose monthly household income was <50,000NT$ reported poorer psychological health (p = 0027) than participants whose monthly household income was >50,000NT$. Participants with a history of depression reported poorer psychological health (p = 0030) than participants with no history of depression. Participants with a history of repeated suicide attempts also reported poorer psychological health (p = 0006) and social relationships (p = 0027) than those without such a history. Moreover, participants who reattempted suicide while receiving suicidal follow-up care reported poorer physical health (p = 0004), psychological health (p < 0001) and social relationships (p = 0033) than those who did not reattempt suicide.

Correlations between BDI scores and WHOQOL domains

Beck Depression Inventory scores were negatively correlated with physical health (r =  067, p < 0001), psychological (r =  074, p < 0001), health social relationships (r =  054, (r =  060, p < 0001) environment and p < 0001) (Fig. 1). Depressive level differed signiﬁcantly by physical health (F = 1742, p < 0001), psychological health (F = 3917, p < 0001), (F = 1054, social relationships p < 0001) and environment (F = 1379, p < 0001). These results indicate that the greater the depressive level, the poorer the QOL among suicidal participants.

Regression model of four WHOQOL domains

The results of generalised linear modelling (Table 3) indicate that participants’ age, reattempting suicide during follow-up and depressive level were signiﬁcantly associated with the physical health domain and accounted for 42% of the variance. Participants’ education level, reattempting suicide during follow-up and depressive level were signiﬁcantly associated with the psychological health domain, accounting for 61% of the variance. Education level and depressive level were signiﬁcantly associated with social relationships, accounting for 328% of the variance. Age, education level and depressive level were signiﬁcantly associated with the environmental domain, accounting for 423% of the variance. Across all domains, depression was a signiﬁcant factor. Participants with more severe depression (higher BDI

and psychological health than those who did not reattempt suicide. Education was another signiﬁcant negative factor in the four WHOQOL domains. Individuals with >12 years of education were more likely to have poorer physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment than those with <12 years of education. Age also had a small effect on both physical health and environment; a 1-year increase in age was signiﬁcantly associated with a 005-point decrease in physical health and a 008-point decrease in environment domain scores. In summary, QOL of participants who had recently attempted suicide was most associated with four variables: depressive level, education level, reattempting suicide during follow-up care and age. These variables explained a large proportion of variability in psychological health, but less variability in social relationships.

Discussion

Nearly half of suicidal participants (n = 49) in this study reported severe depression (BDI score  29). Those with severe depression also reported lower mean scores on all four WHOQOL-BREF domains (physical health,

Table 3 Regression of each WHOQOL-BREF domain with related variables (n = 103)

psychological health, social relationships and environment) than participants with mild or moderate depression. In addition, our participants reported greater depression and poorer QOL than 181 depressed outpatients in Taiwan (Sung & Yeh 2007). This difference is likely due to Sung and Yeh’s sample including depressive outpatients without suicidal ideation. On the other hand, our results are consistent with the ﬁndings for 808 depressed patients in Korea (Jung et al. 2012) and with depressive levels of 70 Brazilian outpatients with and without suicidal ideation, although they had poorer QOL than our participants (Berlim et al. 2003). Thus, different depressive levels differently impact suicidal individuals’ QOL. Over two-thirds of our participants had a history of repeated suicide attempts. Because patients with such a history eventually end their lives by suicide (Hawton et al. 2003), these participants needed intensive suicidal care. Almost one-third of participants reported that they reattempted suicide while receiving suicidal follow-up care. Indeed, these participants were more likely to experience poorer psychological health and social relationships than those who did not repeatedly attempt suicide during the previous three months of follow-up care. Our results on reattempting suicide and poor QOL echo report that patients with schizophrenia (Xiang et al. 2008, Kao et al. 2012) or bipolar disorder (de Abreu et al. 2012) and who previously attempted suicide had signiﬁcantly lower scores in the four WHOQOL-BREF domains than their non-suicidal

counterparts. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that individuals who reattempt suicide and have greater depression are more likely to have poorer QOL. Our participants had a mean score for perceived general QOL of 267, similar to the results from Australia (Goldney et al. 2001) and Finland (Koivumaa-Honkanen et al. 2001). Furthermore, our participants had notably lower mean QOL scores than the general population in Taiwan (The WHOQOL-Taiwan Group 2000) across all four WHOQOL-BREF domains, particularly in four components of psychological health (enjoying life, item 5; meaningful life, item 6; satisﬁed with self, item 19; and negative feelings, item 26) and one component of the environmental domain (enough money). Our suicidal participants also reported even worse QOL across all domains than patients with major depression in Taiwan (Chung et al. 2009), suggesting that a decline in QOL is related to further suicide attempts. Regarding the relationship between QOL and demographic characteristics, participants with >12 years of education were more likely to have poorer QOL across all four domains than those with <12 years of education. Our results differ from previous reports that education level contributed to higher QOL scores (Lin et al. 2008, Jung et al. 2012). This difference may be due to the cultural phenomenon of highly educated suicidal individuals in Chinese societies being more likely to attempt suicide or accept suicide than poorly educated ones (Wang et al. 1998, Li & Phillips 2010). Another factor that may explain our results

is that poor QOL is associated with a sense of stigmatisation (Chung et al. 2009, Yen et al. 2009), and highly educated Taiwanese individuals who have attempted suicide are vulnerable to a greater sense of stigma from suicide (Tzeng & Lipson 2005). Therefore, these results suggest that mental health professionals should treat highly educated individuals who have attempted suicide by establishing trust with them and allowing them to narrate their painful stigmatisation during follow-up. We also found that older participants had poorer QOL in the physical health and environment domains than younger people. This result might have been due to older individuals having comorbid medical conditions and less social support in Chinese societies, as reported (Lin et al. 2008, Chan et al. 2009). Economic issues may have been a critical factor for our participants, but became non-signiﬁcant in the generalised regression analyses. In a related study, low household income contributed to suicide attempts (Sareen et al. 2011). We found that participants, especially those who were highly educated or older, suffered when they had to depend on their even older parents because they were not fulﬁlling their ﬁlial obligation to support them (Ho 1996). Therefore, during follow-up care with suicidal Chinese individuals, mental health professionals should acknowledge their cultural dilemma with ﬁlial piety, frequently reﬂect with them how one’s Chinese background shapes one’s values and communication style, and help them understand such suffering can be meaningful fortheir later lives. Health professionals must also educate family members to appropriately care for such a high-risk population.

Interpretation of the study results is limited by several factors. First, the study used a cross-sectional design so causal relationships cannot be determined between QOL and demographic factors. Longitudinal studies are recommended to clarify these causal relationships. Second, the study instruments were all self-administered. Future studies could conﬁrm self-reported results with more objective measures. Third, study participants were selected by convenience sampling from a northern rural county. In addition, we could not access information on non-responders’ demographic and clinical characteristics due to the study hospital’s regulations on protecting patients’ privacy. Thus, selection of the study sample might have been biased, preventing the results from being generalisable to all suicidal individuals in Taiwan. Finally, we knew little about participants’ family relationships and function as a possible factor inﬂuencing participants’ social relationships and environment. To minimise this factor, future studies should collect data on family relationships.

Conclusion

This paper is the ﬁrst to identify factors associated with the subjective QOL of Taiwanese individuals who attempted suicide within the previous three months. The study ﬁndings indicate that such individuals had poor QOL in all domains of the WHOQOL-BREF. In addition, QOL was negatively associated with several factors, that is, older age, higher education, reattempting suicide during follow-up and severe depression. Knowledge gained from this study is important for mental health professionals to incorporate suicidal patients’ psychological state and life satisfaction during follow-up care.

The ﬁndings from this study suggest that individuals who have attempted suicide and have both severe depression and poor QOL are more likely to make further attempts. Clearly, such knowledge will enable mental health professionals to understand depression as a critical factor associated with QOL in suicidal patients. Thus, mental health professionals should include frequent evaluation of depressive levels and QOL in follow-up care of suicidal patients. In addition, case managers need to attend ongoing education programmes on culturally appropriate care to frequently reﬂect how their own Chinese background shapes their values and communication styles and to understand how suicidal patients bear such suffering after attempting suicide. Therefore, case managers have to establish rapport with suicidal patients and allow patients to articulate their painful experiences during follow-up care. We also suggest that future research includes psychometric measures to explore possible relationships between suicidal patients’ QOL and family function.

Abstract Objective: Exposure to traumatic events may precipitate suicidal ideation. Once an individual is diagnosed with PTSD, a suicide risk assessment often  follows. This study explores how PTSD symptom criteria correlate with suicidal  ideation  in a sample of police officers. While the psychometric measures of PTSD often mirror the DSM-IV-TR criteria, focusing on exposure, symptom, and duration criteria, suicidal ideation measures often focus on concepts quite different from that. In this report the focus was on investigating how PTSD symptom criteria correlate with the suicidal ideation. Method: A group of South African police officers (N = 217) were assessed by means of  the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale and a short version of  the Adult Suicide  Ideation Questionnaire. Linear and hierarchical regressions were used to determine which PTSD symptom criteria best predict suicidal ideation. Results: Hyperarousal was the primary predictor of suicidal ideation (R2 [adjusted] = 0.249). Intrusive thoughts added only marginally to the model, contributing a further 2.5% to the declared variance. The contributions of the other two symptom types were negligible. Conclusion: In this study hyperarousal correlated significantly with suicidal ideation. It is suggested that practitioners be alert to these symptoms as possible indicators of suicidal ideation. Implications for suicide risk assessment and prevention measures are discussed.

Introduction Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterised by a constellation of symptoms, which may be distressing and impairing, after experiencing or being confronted with a traumatic event that includes an actual or perceived threat to self or others.1 Symptoms involve repeated and intrusive memories related to the trauma (e.g., thoughts, dreams or nightmares), avoidance of situations reminiscent of the trauma, and hyperarousal (e.g., sleep difficulties, irritability, reduced concentration, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response).  While reports on prevalence rates for the general population range from 7 to 12%, studies of “at risk” populations, such as combat veterans, demonstrate higher rates of PTSD.2 Significant associations between witness and perpetrator violence and suicidal ideation have also been established.3

It has been posited that exposure to trauma may be an important potential environmental contributor to suicidal behaviour.3 In a review of the literature, a clear relationship was reported between PTSD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours, irrespective of the type of trauma experienced.4 It has been suggested that PTSD has a strong association with suicidality, predicting subsequent suicidal attempts.5 However, despite accumulating evidence regarding increased risk for suicidal behaviour among individuals with a history of trauma and a diagnosis of PTSD, increased suicide risk is hardly mentioned in the trauma literature. Similarly, PTSD is rarely mentioned as a risk factor in literature on suicide.6 While police officers are considered a high risk group for suicide, very little research has been conducted with this group in general.7 This study attempts to address which aspects of PTSD are correlated with suicidal ideation, as not all individuals with PTSD develop suicidal ideation or make such attempts. These data may assist in guiding more rigorous assessments of suicidal ideation in PTSD patients, as well as in the diagnosis and management thereof.  It is important to explore the relationship between PTSD and suicidal ideation, especially within developing, low-income

countries where trauma may be more prevalent and manifest differently than in developed countries.3 Also, attention must be placed on groups that are most vulnerable to trauma experiences. One such high-risk group is police officers in South Africa, who are exposed to traumatic events as part of their occupation and whose repeated exposure to traumatic on-the-job experiences may lead to psychological problems such as PTSD.7 Police officers are also exposed to stress inherent in their jobs which is considered customary, but which exceeds stress inherent in most other professions.7-10 Furthermore, the crime rate in South Africa is high, with approximately 2.1 million serious cases being reported to the police for the year April 2009 to March 2010. Additionally, police officers have become targets of criminal attacks, with 107 being killed in the line of duty in the same period.11 This perceived stress is associated with anxiety, somatisation, depression and PTSD.7 High rates of suicide have been reported in the South African Police Service (SAPS), with an average suicide rate of 74.5 per 100 000 for the period 01 January 1994 to 31 December 2006.12 This is far higher than the suicide figures provided by the World Health Organisation (16/100 000)13 and the South African Department of Health (17.4/100 000).14 The SAPS rates are also higher than those reported by other international law enforcement agencies.15-17 The aim of the study was to examine the possible link between PTSD and suicidal ideation in a representative sample of SAPS officers in Limpopo (a province of South Africa), and to identify whether specific posttraumatic stress symptoms predict suicidal ideation. 

Method Design A cross-sectional survey design was chosen for the research design. This design is suitable for describing the population as well as the calculation of correlations between measured constructs.18 After interviewees were informed and consented to the research process, the data were collected through one-on-one interviews in a private room by a trained interviewer.

Ethics Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA IRB # G07-08-091-01). 

Sample Permission was obtained from the Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo province to recruit confidentially and anonymously a representative sample of police officers from all ranks of operational officers in that province. A representative sample of 300 officers, from all ranks, was randomly extracted from a list containing names of all operational police officers in Limpopo province (+/- 10 000 officers), one of the rural provinces of South Africa. 

Measurement instruments Two instruments were used, one measuring PTSD symptoms and the other suicidal ideation.  1. The Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS)19 is often used to diagnose PTSD and has five items on intrusive thoughts, seven on avoidance and numbing, five on hyperarousal, and nine on associated problems. The first question on intrusive thoughts, for example, reads as follows: “In the past month, did you have upsetting thoughts or images about the traumatic event that

came into your mind when you didn't want them to?” The response format was as follows: 0 - Not at all; 1 - Once a week or less / once in a while; 2 - 2 to 4 times a week / half the week; 3 - 5 or more times a week / almost always. On the associated problems the response format was either yes (1) or no (0). The scores ranged from 0 to 15 for both intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal, 0 to 21 for avoidance and numbing, and 0 to 9 for associated problems. PTSD symptom severity scores can be derived by summing the ratings of the symptoms.19 The PDS total symptom severity scale demonstrates high internal consistency (Alpha = 0.92), test-retest reliability (0.83), convergent validity with other measures of PTSD diagnosis and severity (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient, kappa = 0.65, 82% agreement between the measures), and concurrent validity (with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).19,20 2. An adapted short measure of suicidal ideation with 10 items from the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnairewas utilised.21 The first question reads as follows: “Did you, at least once in the past month, think about killing yourself?” The no (0) / yes (1) response format resulted in a score range of 0 to 10.22 The reported internal consistency of the instrument was acceptable, varying from 0.96 to 0.98.23,24 The test differentiated significantly between suicide attempt and psychiatric control groups.24 The test-retest reliability varies between 0.86 and 0.95, and evidence for the content, construct and criterionrelated validity is avaliable.21,22

Statistical analysis In order to achieve the empirical aim of this research, linear and hierarchical regressions were calculated. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 17, was used.

Results Demographics of the sample From the 300 South African Police Service (SAPS) employees approached to participate in the study, 217 completed interviews were captured. The main reason provided for not participating in the study was the unavailability due to operational commitments. Of the participants 161, or 74.2%, were male and 56, or 25.8%, were female. The average age of the respondents was 40 years, with a standard deviation of 8.26 years. The oldest respondent was born in 1951 and the youngest in 1985. Just more than half of the respondents (n=114, 51.8%) had completed high school (grade 12). A large proportion had completed grade 10 (n=89, 40.5%), while a small proportion (n=11, 5.2%) had a lower educational level (various grades). The lowest educational level was grade 6. Most respondents (194 or 89.4%) had an annual income of less than R150 000, with only 23 or 10.6% earning more than that amount. All the respondents were involved in operational police work in the Limpopo province. No data on race or ethnicity were collected, as the envisaged small group sizes would not have allowed for the use of inferential statistics. 

Reliability The reliability of the PTSD symptom measures, expressed as Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, was 0.854 (n = 213; 5 items) for intrusive thoughts, 0.835 (n = 213; 7 items) for avoidance and numbing, 0.821 (n = 214; 5 items) for hyperarousal, and 0.915 (n = 213; 9 items) for associated problems. The reliability of the suicidal ideation measure was 0.805 (n = 217; 10 items). The reliability of the measures was acceptable.25

African Journal of Psychiatry • January 2013

PTSD symptoms and suicidal ideation The average score on intrusive thoughts were 2.09 (std. dev. = 2.85; range 0 to 15), for avoidance and numbing 3.03 (std. dev. = 4.09; range 0 to 21), for hyperarousal 2.15 (std. dev. = 2.93; range 0 to 15), and for associated problems 1.23 (std. dev. = 2.42; range 0 to 9). The total score for suicidal ideation was 0.57 (std. dev. = 1.38; range 0 to 9). In model 1 of Table I the results of a linear regression with suicidal ideation as the dependent variable and the four symptom groupings are presented. In this model the R2 (adjusted) = 0.281 (R = 0.543; R2 = 0.294; SE of estimate = 1.178).  In respect of model 2 and model 3, the SPSS software was used to remove variables from the regression equation automatically in a stepwise manner. In model 2 only one independent variable was included, namely hyperarousal. In this model the R2 (adjusted) = 0.249 (R = 0.503; R2 = 0.253; SE of estimate = 1.203). In model 3 hyperarousal and intrusive thoughts were included. In model 3 the R2 (adjusted) = 0.274 (R = 0.531; R2 = 0.282; SE of estimate = 1.182). From the aforementioned (see model 2) it can be read that almost 25% (24.9) of the variance in the suicidal ideation score is described by the hyperarousal scores. Adding intrusive thoughts to the equation improved the predictive value of the model with 2.5% to declare 27.4% of the variance (see model 3). Adding the other two variables to the model increases the predictive power by an additional 0.7% (see model 1). A model was also tested where gender was added as a variable to the four PTSD symptom scores. In this model the R2 (adjusted) = 0.285 (R = 0.550; R2 = 0.302; SE of estimate = 1.186), with gender adding only 0.004 to model 1. 

Discussion The purpose of this study was to examine a possible link between PTSD and suicidal ideation and to examine whether there are any specific posttraumatic symptoms that predict suicidal ideation. This study may be the first attempt to identify the characteristics of PTSD that may relate to suicidal ideation in a random sample of active police officers in South Africa. The findings of this study address issues raised in current literature4 in terms of whether there are stronger relationships between any one of the three PTSD symptom clusters and suicidality compared to the other criteria.

Table I: PTSD symptoms and suicidal ideation

Similar to other studies27,28, this study demonstrated that there are certain PTSD criteria that predict suicidal ideation. Hyperarousal was a key factor, and to a lesser extent intrusive thoughts predicted suicidal ideation in this sample. The findings of this study are in line with the findings of earlier researchers who found a relationship between hyperarousal and suicidal risk27 and between intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideation.28 Neither avoidance, numbing, or associated impairment influenced the relationship significantly. Gender also had no significant effect on the relationship.  The finding that hyperarousal is a key predictor of suicidal ideation and possible suicide risk has been interpreted as a problem in impulse control and affect regulation.26 This link is made because hyperarousal is characterised by symptoms that implies problems of control and regulation of impulses, such as hypervigilance, sleep difficulties, outbursts and extreme reactions to sudden noises.1 These findings suggest that arousal and impulsivity may heighten suicide risk. It is possible that those who act impulsively may be more likely to act on suicidal ideation, but this relationship awaits further study.  Possibilities are that individuals who do not engage in avoidance (which is not a significant predictor in this sample) are continually subjected to intrusive thoughts. Intrusive PTSD symptoms produce higher levels of subjective distress which, when heightened enough, activate a flight from intolerable stress through thoughts of self-destruction.27 These findings confirm that intrusive thoughts, rather than avoidance, as found in this study, should relate to suicidal ideation. Police officers and those involved in combat related exposure such as military personnel are trained to be on high alert. Suicidal individuals are characterised by constantly monitoring their interpersonal environment for danger.4 These behaviours may become second nature to them and when combined with repeated and prolonged exposure6, may result in a constant state of high alarm. If the alarm state is elicited too intensely or frequently over an extended period, the energy needed for a return to equilibrium may become depleted, leading to exhaustion.28 Regardless of gender, it has also been reported that police officers have a “superman” mentality and a macho image which they try to protect.8 To compound matters, males, the largest group of employees in the SAPS, often do not seek help and it is often a

African Journal of Psychiatry • January 2013

challenge to identify suicidal men if they do not present themselves for help.29,30 An awareness of the link between PTSD related hyperarousal and suicidal ideation may increase the number of employees identified as at risk for suicide.  While these findings contribute to what we know about the contribution of PTSD symptoms to suicidal ideation, there are limitations to this study. Police officers were not screened for depression, which may have affected these results. In many PTSD studies, suicidality is associated with co-morbid depression. The presence of co-morbid depression appears to boost the effect of PTSD on suicidality.4,5 It has also been reported that when depression was controlled, it weakened but did not eliminate the relationship, leading researchers to conclude that depression plays a mediating role.6 Pre-trauma personality, borderline personality traits as well as other personality traits, such as perfectionism, may contribute to an increased risk of suicide in patients suffering from PTSD6, and these have not been explored in this study. While the issue of rank in the police has also not been explored in this study, and is unlikely to impact on the results, as other research8,9 has found no relationship between rank and stress symptoms (suicidal behaviour is often linked to the presence of stress symptoms31). Also, we did not examine for racial and ethnic differences which prevent the identification of possible health disparities. It will be important for future research to explore such differences, as well as assess whether cultural differences influences appraisal of traumatic experiences and coping strategies. The final limitation is that the findings are specific to police officers and may not be generalisable to other community samples not involved in law enforcement.

Conclusion The findings of this study have important implications for the treatment and management of police officers at risk for PTSD. The study results indicate that there are certain PTSD criteria that can predict suicidal ideation. When individuals present with PTSD, practitioners should be aware that high levels of hyperarousal and, to a lesser extent, intrusive thoughts, which may point towards suicidal ideation. Practitioners should fully and routinely explore these symptoms of PTSD and their possible link to suicidality in their assessments of police officers. This can minimise negative and destructive outcomes associated with suicidal ideation. It is recommended that future studies should not only treat PTSD symptoms holistically as a possible predictor of suicidal behaviour, but examine symptom clusters separately when assessing for suicidality, as the mentioned criteria are central to the prediction of suicidal ideation.
